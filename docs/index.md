Welcome to cert-viewer's documentation!
=======================================
The cert-viewer project is a Flask webapp to display and verify digital certificates after they have been issued and
to allow learners to request a certificate and generate their own Bitcoin identity needed for the certificate creation
 process. [See the schema](https://github.com/digital-certificates/cert-schema).
